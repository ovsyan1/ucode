        What makes a superhero?
    </h2>
    <p>A superhero is a person who does heroic deeds and has the ability to do them in a 
        way that a normal person couldn’t. So in order to be a superhero,<b> you need a power that is more
         exceptional than any power a normal human being could possess</b>, and you need to use that
          power to accomplish good deeds. Otherwise, a policeman or a fireman could be considered a
           superhero. For instance, a good guy fighting a bad guy could be just a regular police story or detective
            story or human-interest story. But if it’s a good guy with a superpower who is fighting a bad guy, it
             becomes a superhero story. If the good guy is doing something that a normal human being couldn’t do,
              couldn’t accomplish, then I assume he becomes a superhero.</p>
